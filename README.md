# Target-Identification-Validation-in-Drug-Discovery

The primary goal of this project is to familiarize the intern with in-silico techniques for identifying and validating potential drug targets. By the end of the project, the intern will have a comprehensive understanding of computational tools and methodologies used in target identification and validation, as well as hands-on experience with relevant bioinformatics software and databases.
